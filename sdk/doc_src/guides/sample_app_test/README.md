#Using the Sample Apps

Now that you have set up the server component of the SDK, you should be able to load the **Sample Apps** in your supported Web browser.

The following section describes how to test your connection to the AT&T APIs using each Sample App.


##OAuth
Device Capabilities and In-App Messaging require users to authorize your app via an OAuth consent. The SDK facilitates this process by presenting the user with the AT&T API Platform access page, capturing their authorization code, requesting and storing the user’s access token. The user needs to authorize consent only once per session.

A user accessing In-App Messaging features will be presented with a Consent Request screen requesting app authorization to an AT&T wireless number or account. Device Capabilities uses OAuth authentication but it will not show a consent screen. The authorization is performed automatically if you are on the AT&T network.

(**) The authentication pages shown below are from AT&T servers, not the SDK. The UI may be updated and slightly different from the screenshots below.

There are several authentication methods you can use, but the easiest and fastest method is using an AT&T device with an active wireless number to send an authorization password to the AT&T short code:

![Oauth](resources/images/sample_apps_screens/oauth-one.png)

When the correct password is received, you will see a screen like the following indicating that you have authorized the request:

![Oauth](resources/images/sample_apps_screens/oauth-close.png)

Make sure to select "Close window" to redirect the user back to your app and deliver the OAuth token to the server.

##Speech File to Text
Point your browser to this address: 

    http://{yourdomain}:{port}/Speech/App1/index.html 

Select the _Speech Context_, chose a _File_, and press the **Submit** button to get a translation into text of the selected audio file.

##Recorded Speech to Text
Point your browser to this address: 

    http://{yourdomain}:{port}/Speech/App2/index.html 

Use the provided audio controls to record speech and submit the audio to view the resulting text from the AT&T Speech-to-Text API.

Note that your browser must support current Web audio standards in order to use this sample.

##Text To Speech
Point your browser to this address: 

    http://{yourdomain}:{port}/Speech/App3/index.html 

Type English text into the provided text input area, and tap **Submit** to send the text to the AT&T Text-to-Speech API. Tap **Play converted speech** to hear the resulting audio.

##SMS
This sample app demonstrates SMS messages sent from and to your app.

Point your browser to this address: 

    http://{yourdomain}:{port}/SMS/App1/index.html 

This sample app showcases three different features. The first one sends a short message to a given phone number: enter the _Phone Number_ and the _Message_ and press the **Send Message** button. 

After sending your message, you will see a screen showing the **Message ID** that corresponds to the sent message.
 
To retrieve the status of the message, tap **Get Status**. 

To check the messages sent to a specific short code, you must have at least one short code configured on your AT&T Developer Program app. To add a short code, open the configuration file at this location:  

	/webcontent/SMS/App1/app/Config.js

Configure the parameters for the short codes:
     
    /**
     * short code or Registration ID
     */
    shortCode         : 'your short code here',
    
    /**
     * short code or Registration ID used on SMS sample app to receive messages from the second button
     */
    anotherShortCode  : 'a second short code here',

To retrieve messages sent to the short code, tap **Get Messages for Short Code**.


##SMS Voting
Point your browser to this address: 

    http://{yourdomain}:{port}/SMS/App2/index.html 

This sample app demonstrates the callback functionality. In this sample, the app counts votes sent to a specific short code using specific text in the message body. 

To configure your short code on the app, open the configuration file at this location:  

	/webcontent/SMS/App2/app/Config.js

Configure the parameters for the short code:

	/**
     * short code or Registration ID
     */
    shortCode         : 'your short code here'

The app will count messages to the short code with the text **"Football"**, **"Basketball”**, or **"Baseball”**.

**Note:** Make sure to configure the callback for your short code so it points to:

	http://{yourdomain}:{port}/att/sms/votelistener

You cannot use _localhost_ or 127.0.0.1 for this callback; it must be an internet address where AT&T can successfully send notification messages.
	
##MMS
Point your browser to this address: 

    http://{yourdomain}:{port}/MMS/App1/index.html 

This sample application sends a multimedia message to a given phone number. Enter the _Phone Number_ and the _Message_, select an image from the _Choose File_ menu and tap **Send Message**. 

After sending a message, the app displays a **Message ID** corresponding to the message sent.  To retrieve the status of the message, tap **Get Status**. 

##MMS Gallery
Point your browser to this address: 

    http://{yourdomain}:{port}/MMS/App2/index.html 

The gallery application showcases the MMS callback feature, which displays the images sent to the configured short code. 

Configure your short code using the configuration file at this location:  

	/webcontent/MMS/App2/app/Config.js

Configure the parameters for the short code:

	/**
     * short code or Registration ID
     */
    shortCode         : 'your short code here'


**Note:** You must configure the callback for the short code in your application so that it points to this location:

	http://{yourdomain}:{port}/att/mms/gallerylistener

You cannot use _localhost_ or 127.0.0.1 for this callback; it must be an internet address where AT&T can successfully send notification messages.

##Device Capabilities
Point your browser to this address: 

    http://{yourdomain}:{port}/DC/App1/index.html 

Tap the button to retrieve information about your device. This sample app will only work when your internet connection is provided by a device on the AT&T network. You should either navigate to this sample app directly from your AT&T device, or use an AT&T device to provide a Wi-Fi hotspot.

##In-App Messaging
Point your browser to this address: 

    http://{yourdomain}:{port}/IAM/App3/index.html 

This sample showcases the In-App Messaging functionality. It displays the authenticated user's inbox, with the ability to send, delete, and update messages, as well as view message attachments.

You can specify up to 10 addresses by separating them with commas. Valid addresses include:

* AT&T Wireless Numbers
* Email Addresses
* Short Codes

You can send a message to up to 10 different addresses.

In-App Messaging notifications will be received by the app server at https://your_app_server_domain_name:4568/att/notification/v1/callback.

##Advertising
Point your browser to this address: 

    http://{yourdomain}:{port}/ADS/App1/index.html 

This application submits demographic information and returns an appropriate targeted advertisement.
